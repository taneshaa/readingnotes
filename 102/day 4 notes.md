Architecture of a program:
Output is your end result
Steps
Getting results back

Programming: step by step process

Every time you write a program think of it like you’re teaching a machine to do a trick/task

Write a function that makes a sandwich
Have that sandwich accept user input
Allow input to make whatever sandwich with the input given

Create new file called sandwich is JS
Create a function 
Create a variable and set it equal to a function
Step 1. Gather ingredients 
Step2. Put it together (variable)
Step3. Invoke function(return your result)
Step4. Refactor 

Let makeMeASandwich = function () {


//DECALRE function
function makeASandwich(){}
 Let bread = ‘sourdough’;
Let meat = ‘ham’;
Let cheese = ‘Swiss’;
Let condiments = ‘Mayo & mustard’;
Let veg = ‘lettuce’;

OR

Let ingrediants = bread + …….
Return ‘here is your sandwich on’ + bread + ‘containing’ + meat + ’ , ’ + cheese + ‘ , ’ + condiments ‘ , and’ veg;
}
